* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository lets git keep track of a commit history , stored a meta-data
in a hidden file

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you set up files to be commited. The working direcotry is just
a collection of files in a directory. Same goes for the repository, with additional meta-data
added.
