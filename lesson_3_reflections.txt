1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other people over the internet

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I can imagine you are working on a project where you don't want stuff from Github (made by
other users) interfering with that
